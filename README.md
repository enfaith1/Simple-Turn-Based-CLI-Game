## Game Mechanics

### Turn Order
- The game alternates turns between the player and the bot.
- You choose who goes first from the main menu.

### Player Actions
On your turn, you can choose one of the following actions:
- **ATTACK:**  
  - Deal random damage (1-10) to the bot.
  - After attacking, there is a 25% chance the bot will instantly heal back the damage you dealt (HP Backtrack).
- **STUN:**  
  - Attempt to stun the bot, skipping its next turn(s) and dealing extra damage.
  - Stun chances:
    - 30% chance to stun once (deal 1x damage, skip 1 bot turn).
    - 10% chance to stun twice (deal 2x damage, skip 2 bot turns).
    - 1% chance to stun thrice (deal 3x damage, skip 3 bot turns).
  - After a successful stun, the action goes on cooldown for the same number of turns as the stun duration.
  - If stun is on cooldown, you cannot use it until the cooldown expires.
- **SKIP:**  
  - Skip your turn without taking any action.
- **EXIT:**  
  - Exit the game immediately.
